# Dry Bean Dataset

The Dry Bean Dataset was collected by Prof. Murat Koklu and Prof. Ilker Ali Ozkan in 2020. This dataset extracted from 13,611 images of grains from 7 types of dry beans, namely Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz, and Sira. A computer vision system was utilized to distinguish each dry bean based on observable characteristics, like area, parameter, aspect ratio, solidity, roundness, etc. The image extraction produces 16 numerical features that act as input data for classification.

## Methods include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing
- Z-Score Normalization
- Machine Learning modelling: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree
- Evaluation: Classification Report and Performance Comparison
